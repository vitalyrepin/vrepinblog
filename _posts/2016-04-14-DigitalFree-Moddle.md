If you are interested in launching your own instance of the Stallman's course "On the Road to the Free Digital Society", I have good news for you.
I have published the course in Moodle Backup and IMS Common Cartridge formats.

The files are available in the ["Download" section](http://digitalfree.info/FreeDigitalSociety/downloads/index.html) of the course website.

I will be happy to hear your feedback about the course!

Don't forget that we need your help in several areas:

- [Translations and subtitles](https://github.com/vitalyrepin/FreedomRMS/tree/master/subtitles)
- Spreading the world about the course
- Launching the course in the LMS platforms you have access to
